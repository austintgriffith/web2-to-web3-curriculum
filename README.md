# web2 to web3 - a curated, free, and open-source curriculum
>The journey from 0 to hero for any developer to learn web3 and building on Ethereum.

*prerequisites: you can write javascript but you don't need to know anything about web3*

Week 1 - Becoming a power user and getting context
- day 1: intro %TODO% - %%% we'll come back to this and fill in whatever details we need to cover up front %%%
*   discussions: Blockchains, decentralization, Unstoppable apps, money/incentives at the protocol, coordination
*   Redundancy, Censorship resistance, web3 cron jobs are different, trust (escrow is a good way to explain)
*   apps: what are people building? NFT, DEFI, DAOS - disclaimer: some garbage
*   (juan benet has a good talk about building incentives to drive behaviours, probably some good vitalik articles too)
*   gotchas: expensive, mnemonic lost means everything lost, chain is hard to parse, apps are centralized, so much noise
- day 2: wallets, private key in eth.build, learn how to keep a mnemonic safe, learn how to send eth, learn how to use etherscan 
*   get everyone to setup a metamask and get their addresses in a tip.party and drop testnet/ETH to everyone
- day 3: Get an ENS (talk about identity), swap to a stable coin (talk about DEXs and stables)
*   notice how your ENS follows you to Uniswap and you can see your stables in zapper 
*   where DIDs are stored, Lens protocol, and cermaic 
- day 4: NFT day! Buy and trade NFTS, maybe use an NFT to token gate a chat? POAPs!
*   IPFS and offchain storage - maybe graph? 
- day 5: DAOs, multsigs, wallet connect


Week 2 - Scripting and Deeper Concepts
- day 1: simple script to talk to providers, get balance - RPCs
*   formatEther, parseEther!!
- day 2: sending transactions 
*   discussions about: gas prices, mempool, front-running
- day 3: interacting with contracts
- day 4: parsing blocks to find all transactions from an account (Indexer!)
*   leads you to graph and/or running your own geth node
- day 5: advanced: sign, recover, encrypt, and decrypt


Week 3 - Smart Contracts / Solidity  - Building Dapps - SRE
- day 1: Start with Remix and show smart contracts from the browser - learn how to tinker
*   high level: Massive multiplayer programmable vending machine - remember: unstoppable apps, design incentives 
*   discussions about: solidity syntax, storage vs events, require, mappings, paybable functions 
*   (solidity by example copy pasting like crazy!)
- day 2: SpeedRunEthereum.com - Challenge 0 - NFT deployed to testnet
- day 3: SpeedRunEthereum.com - Challenge 1 - Staking app 
- day 4: SpeedRunEthereum.com - Challenge 2 - Token Vendor
- day 5: Choose your own adventure: DEX, multisig, or SVG NFT

Week 4 - Build your own project 
- day 1: open/social call to cover:
*   final concepts and questions
*   ideation and team forming
- day 2-4: checkins, off hours
- day 5: show off what you built!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Success tier 1: Get hired as a junior with your Speed Run portfolio... build things and show them off on twitter! 

Success tier 2: Build your own product or start building forkable examples and tutorials for the ecosystem 
(Go learn something and then leave the camp site better than you found it. Help the next dev learn what you learned, but easier.) 

Success tier 3: Go crush some of the harder challenges like the ethernaut, read through previous audits, start auditing yolos from the BG, get introduced to audit firms and folks within our network that are at the cutting edge with solidity auditing...
